## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Get up-to-date weather information for any location.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy navigation.
- **Secure API Proxy**: Ensures safe and reliable data fetching.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Lightweight**: Fast loading times and minimal resource usage.

## Technologies Used

This app utilizes a range of technologies to deliver its functionality:

- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language for client-side scripting.
- **Node.js**: Used for server-side operations.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **API**: For fetching weather data securely.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Badget07/app-weather-forecast.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd app-weather-forecast
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file**: 
   In the root directory, create a file named `.env` and add your API key:
   ```
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now you can access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can enter a city name in the search bar to get the current weather conditions. The app will display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather.

### Example Input

- **City**: London
- **Output**: 
  - Temperature: 15¬∞C
  - Humidity: 80%
  - Wind Speed: 10 km/h
  - Description: Overcast clouds

## API Integration

The app fetches weather data using a secure API proxy. This ensures that sensitive information, like API keys, is not exposed to the client-side. 

### How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters a city name.
2. **API Call**: The app sends a request to the API via the server.
3. **Data Retrieval**: The server fetches the weather data and sends it back to the client.
4. **Display Data**: The app displays the weather information to the user.

### Security Features

- **CORS**: The app implements Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to allow secure data requests.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information is stored in environment variables to keep it secure.
